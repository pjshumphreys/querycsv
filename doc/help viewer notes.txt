posix - use ioctl sioswinch and terminfo codes. use a virtual 80 columns. if isatty is false just quit.

dos - output vt100 get cursor position code. wait .1 of a second and if there's an approprate response use it to
determine screen size.
if file or not special CON device then just quit.
otherwise, check video mode. set it to 07h if its 07h or 0fh. otherwise set it to 03h. screen dimensions are 80x25
use 10h services to control cursor

windows - use win32 functions to get/update screen size and control cursor. if not console output just quit.

cpm - if msx, use F3B0h and F3B1h to determine screen dimensions and use vt52 codes with a virtual 32 columns.
otherwise, if vt100 is detected, use vt100 codes to determine screen size. use a virtual 80 columns
otherwise, ask the user how many columns their screen has, then just display line by line

bbcarm - check screen mode. if mode 2 or 5 then set mode 6. determine screen size using current mode. use adm3a codes

zx - use hardcoded 32x24 mode and update sysvars to control print position

c64 - use hardcoded 40x25 and and update sysvars to control print position. support for c128 80 column mode?

atarist - use vt52 codes and hardcoded 80x24

amiga - use vt100 codes, but check if window is resized somehow. always use a virtual 80 columns

riscos - just display the whole file in 80 columns using taskwindow. add a help menu option to the launcher

macos, powermac - open the help file in a separate window with no formatting but with word wrap.
                  load the text from the resource fork


virtual column size makes use of horizontal scolling


on disk line lookup table format (maybe this could be created dynamically as the file is read?)
--------------------------------
1 byte - chars in line. this is 255 for the last line
1 byte - number of chars to seek backward to reach the beginning of the previous line.
         this is 0 for the first line.


32 character line
