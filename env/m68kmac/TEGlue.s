|
|    TESample is an example application that demonstrates how
|    to initialize the commonly used toolbox managers, operate
|    successfully under MultiFinder, handle desk accessories and
|    create, grow, and zoom windows. The fundamental TextEdit
|    toolbox calls and TextEdit autoscroll are demonstrated. It
|    also shows how to create and maintain scrollbar controls.
|
|    It does not by any means demonstrate all the techniques you
|    need for a large application. In particular, Sample does not
|    cover exception handling, multiple windows/documents,
|    sophisticated memory management, printing, or undo. All of
|    these are vital parts of a normal full-sized application.
|
|    This application is an example of the form of a Macintosh
|    application; it is NOT a template. It is NOT intended to be
|    used as a foundation for the next world-class, best-selling,
|    600K application. A stick figure drawing of the human body may
|    be a good example of the form for a painting, but that does not
|    mean it should be used as the basis for the next Mona Lisa.
|
|    We recommend that you review this program or Sample before
|    beginning a new application. Sample is a simple app. which doesn’t
|    use TextEdit or the Control Manager.

|    AsmClikLoop
|
|    This routine gets called by the TextEdit Manager from TEClick.
|    It calls the old, default click loop routine that scrolls the
|    text, and then calls our own Pascal routine that handles
|    tracking the scroll bars to follow along.  It doesn't bother
|    with saving registers A0 and D0, because they are trashed
|    anyway by TextEdit.
